# Touch-ID-
This Touch ID Extension Attribute identifies whether your Mac hardware supports Touch ID. If Touch ID is not supported, the attribute will indicate 'Unsupported.' On the other hand, if your Mac hardware does support Touch ID, the attribute will provide a list of User IDs enrolled for Touch ID unlock or indicate that Touch ID is not enabled for unlock.  
This script, written in zsh, lists all users enrolled in Touch ID with "unlock with fingerprint" enabled on macOS.
